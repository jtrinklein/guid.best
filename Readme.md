# GUID.Best

This is a site I created just to be a simple GUID generator.

Originally I was trying to keep everything simple so its just HTML, CSS and pure javascript. Recently I've decided to use this as an opportunity to write a simple web app using different frameworks. I try to archive previous versions whenever possible and keep them live. Deployment is handled using [pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) and the actual guid generator is taken from [node-uuid](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid).

I'll track issues and feature requests here.

Check it out live at [guid.best](https://guid.best/), [new.guid.best](https://new.guid.best/), or [my.guid.best](https://my.guid.best/).
